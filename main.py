# Flask Application Design

# HTML Files
# index.html: The main page of the experiment, containing the necessary form for collecting participant information and initiating the experiment.
# results.html: The page displaying the experiment results, including typing speed and accuracy measurements before and after using the pretyping application.

# Routes
# home: The route for the index.html page, serving as the starting point of the experiment.
# start: The route handling the initiation of the experiment. It records the participant's typing speed and accuracy before using the application.
# submit: The route handling the submission of the experiment results. It records the participant's typing speed and accuracy after using the application and performs statistical analysis to determine if there is a significant improvement.
# results: The route for the results.html page, displaying the experiment results to the participants.

# Code Generation
# The Assistant analyzes the provided design and generates the main Python code (main.py) to build the Flask application based on the analysis.

# Code Validation
# After the code generation, the Assistant validates the code. This includes checking for proper references to all variables used in the HTML files.
# If any discrepancies or errors are found during the validation process, the Assistant corrects them.

# Output
# The output of the Assistant's tasks must be the corrected and validated Python code for the Flask application.
# No other files or outputs are allowed; only the Python code must be available after the Assistant completes its tasks.

# Constraints
# The Assistant should not create or include any unnecessary files or outputs.
# The Assistant's tasks and outputs must strictly follow the provided design and problem to avoid any irrelevant or incorrect code generation.

# Response Formatting
# The Assistant's responses should be presented as valid Python code, correctly using Python syntax and conventions.
# The Assistant must ensure the generated code is well-structured and easy to understand, including proper indentation, use of comments, and clear variable naming.
